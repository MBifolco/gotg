Excellent work, team! Planning phase is complete.

## Summary Generated

I've extracted the complete task list from your planning discussion. Here's what was agreed upon:

**12 Tasks Identified:**

**Foundation:**
1. Basic countdown timer with display, bell, and completion
2. State persistence with error handling, concurrency detection, and format definition

**Core Functionality:**
3. Break sessions with visual distinction
4. Cycle tracking (1-4 position, long break determination)
5. Resume/void interrupted work sessions
6. Handle interrupted breaks (auto-complete, prompt next)

**Commands:**
7. Status command (read-only state query)
8. Reset command (with confirmation)
9. Void command (work sessions only)
10. Help and version commands

**Logging & Robustness:**
11. History logging (append-only, Unix-parseable)
12. Error handling and graceful shutdown

**Key Attributes:**
- Each task has clear done criteria, manual test, and deliverable
- Dependencies mapped (foundation → core → integration)
- Estimated at ~2 weeks with 3 engineers
- Platform support: Linux and macOS
- Zero-config Phase 1

**Critical Decisions:**
- Format emerges from T4 implementation (not separate design phase)
- T4 includes error handling and concurrency (not split out)
- T1 keeps timer logic and display together (avoid coordination overhead)
- Cross-platform paths follow OS conventions (XDG for Linux, App Support for macOS)

The task list has been written to `tasks.json` for the PM to assign.
