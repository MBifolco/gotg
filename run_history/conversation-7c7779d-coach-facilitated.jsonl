{"from": "agent-1", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "Great, let's start breaking this down! Here are my initial thoughts:\n\n**Core Understanding:**\nWe're building a CLI tool for time management using the Pomodoro Technique. The basic flow should be: work session \u2192 break \u2192 repeat, with some way to track what was accomplished.\n\n**Key Questions I have:**\n\n1. **User Configuration:**\n   - Should users be able to configure work/break durations at runtime (per session) or via a config file, or both?\n   - What are reasonable defaults? (Standard is 25 min work / 5 min break, with longer breaks after 4 pomodoros)\n   - Should users be able to configure the number of pomodoros before a long break?\n\n2. **Session Logging:**\n   - What information should we log? Just timestamps, or also task descriptions, completion status, interruptions?\n   - Where should logs be stored? Local file, database?\n   - Should users be able to tag or categorize sessions?\n\n3. **Desktop Notifications:**\n   - What events trigger notifications? (Work session ending, break ending, both?)\n   - Should notifications be optional/configurable?\n\n4. **CLI Interaction Model:**\n   - Should this be an interactive session (start timer, it runs until complete)?\n   - Can users pause/resume/cancel timers mid-session?\n   - Should there be commands to view past sessions or statistics?\n\n5. **Scope boundaries:**\n   - Are we building just the timer, or also analytics/reporting features?\n   - Integration with other tools (calendar, task trackers)?\n\nWhat do you all think? What should we prioritize understanding first?"}
{"from": "agent-2", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-1 Good start on gathering requirements! Let me push back on a few things and add some considerations:\n\n**On Configuration:**\nYou mentioned both runtime and config file options - but do we really need both? That adds complexity. I'd argue we should pick one primary method and maybe support the other as a convenience. What's the actual user workflow we're optimizing for? \n\n- If someone uses this daily with the same settings, config file makes sense\n- If they vary their pomodoro lengths based on task type, runtime flags are better\n\nWe need to decide: is this tool for someone who wants consistency, or flexibility? That should drive our configuration story.\n\n**On Session Logging - I think we're missing something critical:**\nBefore we decide *what* to log, we need to understand *why* users want logs. Are they:\n- Tracking productivity metrics over time?\n- Recording what they worked on for time-tracking purposes?\n- Just keeping a simple history?\n\nEach of these implies different data models. For example, if it's productivity metrics, we don't need task descriptions. If it's time-tracking, we absolutely do.\n\n**On the CLI Interaction Model:**\nYou asked if users can pause/resume - but should they? The Pomodoro Technique is specifically about uninterrupted focus blocks. If we allow pausing, are we undermining the methodology? Or is that being too prescriptive?\n\nI think we need to decide: are we building a strict pomodoro timer, or a flexible focus-session tool that happens to default to pomodoro intervals?\n\n**Edge cases I'm wondering about:**\n- What happens if a user starts a timer and closes the terminal?\n- Should the timer survive system sleep/wake?\n- What if someone starts a timer, forgets about it, and starts another one?\n\n@coach Maybe we should start by defining our primary user persona? That might help us make these scope decisions more consistently."}
{"from": "agent-3", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-1 @agent-2 Great questions from both of you. Let me add some thoughts and challenge a few assumptions:\n\n**On Configuration Complexity:**\n@agent-2 I actually think we might need both runtime and config file options, but for different reasons than you might think. Here's why: A config file gives you sane defaults for your typical workflow, but runtime flags let you adapt without editing files. Think about it - \"I usually do 25/5, but today I need shorter sessions because of meetings\" is a real scenario. The complexity isn't that high if we think of it as \"config file = defaults, flags = overrides.\"\n\nBut that raises a question: **Should runtime overrides persist, or only apply to the current session?** That could get confusing.\n\n**On Session Logging Purpose:**\n@agent-2 you're absolutely right that we need to understand the \"why\" first. But I'd push back on your either/or framing. Can't logs serve multiple purposes? A timestamp + optional task description seems like it could support all three use cases you mentioned without much overhead. \n\nThough this makes me wonder: **If task descriptions are optional, how do we handle sessions with no description? Are they just anonymous pomodoros?** That could make the logs less useful for time-tracking purposes.\n\n**On Pausing - I have strong opinions here:**\n@agent-2 you're right that traditional Pomodoro is about uninterrupted focus. But here's the reality: things happen. Someone comes to your desk, there's a fire drill, whatever. I think we need to distinguish between:\n- **Pause** (temporary, you're coming back)\n- **Cancel** (abandon this pomodoro entirely)\n- **Skip break** (finish pomodoro but go straight to the next one)\n\nThe question is: **if someone pauses for 10 minutes, does that still count as a valid pomodoro? Should we track interruption count/duration?**\n\n**On the Edge Cases:**\nThe terminal closing issue is huge. I think we need to decide early: **Is this a foreground process that dies with the terminal, or does it daemonize/run in the background?** That fundamentally changes the architecture.\n\nFor multiple simultaneous timers: I'd argue that should be explicitly disallowed. If the tool's purpose is focus, having two concurrent timers is contradictory. **Should we lock the timer using a PID file or similar?**\n\n**New Questions I Have:**\n1. **What's the minimal viable feature set?** We're discussing a lot of features. What can we ship first vs. what's enhancement territory?\n2. **Sound/audio alerts** - just notifications, or also audio cues? Some people work in environments where notifications might get missed.\n3. **What happens at the end of a break?** Does the next work session start automatically, or wait for user confirmation? Auto-start might not work if they walked away during the break.\n\n@coach I agree with @agent-2 that defining our user persona could help resolve some of these questions. Are we building for the pomodoro purist or the pragmatic developer who wants a flexible focus tool?"}
{"from": "coach", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "Thank you all for this excellent start! You've identified many important questions. Let me summarize where we are:\n\n## What We've Agreed On:\n- CLI-based pomodoro timer\n- Needs work/break intervals, notifications, and session logging\n- Standard defaults likely 25/5 minutes with longer breaks after 4 pomodoros\n\n## Key Unresolved Items (in rough priority order):\n\n**1. Primary User/Philosophy** - Are we building for:\n- Strict pomodoro methodology adherence, or\n- Flexible focus-session tool with pomodoro defaults?\n\n**2. Architecture Decision** - Foreground vs. background process:\n- Dies with terminal vs. survives terminal close?\n- This impacts many other decisions\n\n**3. Configuration Approach:**\n- Config file only, runtime flags only, or both (with override model)?\n- Should runtime changes persist?\n\n**4. Session Logging Purpose & Data Model:**\n- Why are users logging? (metrics, time-tracking, simple history)\n- What data to capture? (timestamps only vs. + descriptions/tags)\n- Optional vs. required task descriptions?\n\n**5. Timer Control Features:**\n- Can users pause/resume/cancel?\n- How to handle interruptions?\n- Multiple concurrent timers - allow or prevent?\n\n**6. Break/Session Transitions:**\n- Auto-start next session or require confirmation?\n- Skip break feature needed?\n\n**7. Notification Details:**\n- Audio + visual, or visual only?\n- Which events trigger them?\n\nThe user persona question seems foundational. **@agent-1 @agent-2 @agent-3: Can we start by aligning on who we're building this for and whether we're strict-pomodoro or flexible-focus?** This should help resolve several downstream decisions."}
{"from": "agent-1", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@coach Good synthesis! I agree the user persona is foundational. Let me propose a perspective:\n\n**I think we should build for the \"pragmatic developer\" rather than the pomodoro purist.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Real-world messiness:** Developers get interrupted - production issues, teammate questions, meetings that run over. A tool that's too rigid won't get used. It'll be abandoned for something more forgiving.\n\n2. **CLI users are already opinionated:** If someone is choosing a CLI tool over the dozens of GUI pomodoro apps, they likely want control and customization. They're probably comfortable with configuration.\n\n3. **Progressive adoption:** Someone new to pomodoro might need to experiment with intervals. \"25 minutes is too long for me, let me try 15\" should be easy.\n\n**However**, I don't think \"flexible\" means \"no opinions.\" We should still:\n- Default to standard pomodoro intervals (25/5/15)\n- Encourage the methodology through good UX\n- Make the \"happy path\" be proper pomodoro technique\n\n**This framing helps me answer several questions:**\n\n- **Config vs runtime flags?** Both. Config for defaults, flags for adaptation. Runtime changes should NOT persist (that's surprising behavior).\n\n- **Pause/resume?** Yes, allow it, but maybe track it. Log \"interrupted pomodoros\" separately from completed ones. This gives flexibility while preserving data integrity for those who care about metrics.\n\n- **Session logging purpose?** Support time-tracking use case (the most demanding). If we capture timestamps + optional task description, simpler use cases (just metrics, just history) are automatically covered. Make descriptions optional but encouraged.\n\n- **Foreground vs background?** This is trickier. My instinct says foreground for simplicity - you see the timer running, it's present. BUT... @agent-3's point about terminal closing is real. \n\n**Actually, wait - let me challenge myself here:** If I'm a developer in a terminal, and I accidentally close it, losing my timer would be frustrating. Maybe we need a hybrid approach? \n\n**Alternative idea:** What if the timer itself runs in the foreground, but we checkpoint state to disk periodically? If it gets killed, we could have a separate command like `pomodoro resume` that detects the interrupted session and asks what to do with it?\n\n@agent-2 @agent-3 Does the \"pragmatic developer\" persona resonate with you? And what do you think about the foreground-with-checkpointing idea vs. true background daemon?"}
{"from": "agent-2", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-1 I appreciate the thorough reasoning, but I want to challenge some of your conclusions:\n\n**On \"Pragmatic Developer\" vs \"Pomodoro Purist\":**\n\nI actually think this is a false dichotomy. Here's why: the developers who choose a CLI pomodoro tool aren't just looking for flexibility - they're looking for something that stays out of their way but keeps them disciplined. If they wanted maximum flexibility, they'd just use any timer app or even `sleep 1500 && notify-send \"break time\"`.\n\nI think the real persona is: **\"Developer who values focus and wants accountability, but in a terminal-native way.\"**\n\nThis persona still wants the structure of pomodoro (that's why they're not just using a generic timer), but they want it integrated into their terminal workflow.\n\n**Where I disagree with your conclusions:**\n\n1. **On config file + runtime flags \"both\":** You say runtime changes shouldn't persist - I agree. But then why support both? If config file is for defaults and someone wants different intervals occasionally, they can just edit the config. Adding both is complexity that serves a marginal convenience. \n\n   **Counter-proposal:** Config file only, but make it dead simple to edit (maybe even a `pomodoro config --work 15` command that updates the file for you). This gives flexibility without dual configuration systems.\n\n2. **On allowing pause with tracking:** This sounds good in theory, but it creates ambiguity. If I pause for 2 minutes, is that an \"interrupted pomodoro\"? What about 10 seconds? What about 30 minutes? We'd need to define thresholds, which is arbitrary. \n\n   **I think we need to decide:** Either pauses are allowed and normal (just stop the clock), OR interruptions invalidate the pomodoro (must cancel and restart). The middle ground of \"tracking interruption quality\" feels like premature optimization.\n\n3. **On session logging for time-tracking:** You say support the most demanding use case. But time-tracking implies describing *what* you worked on, which means task descriptions become effectively mandatory. If they're optional, half your logs will be useless for time-tracking.\n\n   **Question for the group:** Should we make task descriptions mandatory? Or acknowledge that this won't be a great time-tracking tool and optimize for simpler use cases?\n\n**On the foreground/background question:**\n\nYour checkpointing idea is interesting, but I think it's overengineered. Let me propose something simpler:\n\n**What if the timer runs in the foreground, and we accept that closing the terminal ends the session?** BUT - we log the session as \"incomplete\" with actual duration. Then you can see \"oh, I started a pomodoro at 2pm but only got 8 minutes in before something happened.\"\n\nThis is simple, predictable behavior. No magic, no resume command, no state management complexity. And it still gives you useful data.\n\n**The terminal closing \"problem\" might not be a real problem:** How often do developers accidentally close terminals with active processes? And if you're intentionally closing it, you probably don't care about that timer anyway.\n\n@agent-3 You raised the terminal closing issue - do you think it's common enough to warrant background daemon complexity? Or would simple \"incomplete session\" logging suffice?\n\n@coach I think we're circling around a key decision point: **How much magic/complexity are we willing to add for resilience vs. keeping things simple and predictable?**"}
{"from": "agent-3", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-2 You make some compelling points, but I'm not fully convinced. Let me think through this:\n\n**On the Persona:**\nYou're right that \"pragmatic\" vs \"purist\" might be a false dichotomy. But I'd frame your persona slightly differently: **\"Developer who wants structure that adapts to reality.\"** The terminal-native aspect is about workflow integration, not just minimalism. And workflow integration means handling interruptions gracefully, not pretending they don't happen.\n\n**On Configuration - I'm partially swayed:**\nYour `pomodoro config --work 15` idea is clever - it gives the flexibility of runtime flags without dual systems. But here's where I'm not convinced: what if I want to do *one* short session without changing my defaults permanently? \n\nThink about the workflow: \"I have 15 minutes before a meeting, let me do a quick pomodoro\" - should that require:\n1. `pomodoro config --work 15`\n2. `pomodoro start`\n3. `pomodoro config --work 25` (reset to default)\n\nvs. just: `pomodoro start --work 15`?\n\n**Counter-question:** What if we support ONLY runtime flags and no config file? That's also \"one system.\" But I suspect you'll say that's annoying for daily use, which proves we need both paradigms somehow.\n\n**On Pause/Interruption Tracking:**\nYou raise a great point about arbitrary thresholds. But I think you're creating a false choice. Here's a third option: **Allow pause, but don't track \"quality\" at all.** Just log that the pomodoro was paused X times for Y total duration. No judgment, no thresholds, just data. The user can interpret it.\n\nBut actually... now I'm questioning whether we need pause at all. If something interrupts you, maybe the right answer IS to cancel and start fresh. That's more true to the methodology. **Should we just support cancel/restart and drop pause entirely?** That's simpler and more honest.\n\n**On Task Descriptions:**\nYou've identified a real tension. If descriptions are optional and most people skip them, the logs aren't useful for time-tracking. If they're mandatory, the tool becomes more demanding to use.\n\n**Here's what I think:** We should make descriptions optional at START, but prompt for them at END. Like:\n```\nPomodoro complete! What did you work on? (or press Enter to skip)\n>\n```\n\nThis way it's not a barrier to starting a timer, but we still encourage the habit. People doing simple productivity tracking can skip it; people doing time-tracking will fill it in.\n\n**On Foreground vs Background:**\n@agent-2 You ask how often developers accidentally close terminals - in my experience, more often than you'd think. Especially:\n- Terminal tabs that get closed as part of window management\n- System crashes or forced reboots\n- Accidentally hitting Ctrl+D instead of Ctrl+C\n- Shell session timeouts on remote machines\n\nYour \"incomplete session logging\" idea is reasonable, but here's my concern: **If I close a terminal and lose my timer, how do I even know to check the logs?** There's no notification that the break ended. I might forget I even started a timer.\n\n**Here's a question for both of you:** What if we support BOTH modes with a flag? `pomodoro start --daemon` runs in background, `pomodoro start` runs in foreground. This lets users choose based on their context:\n- Working on a stable desktop setup? Foreground is fine.\n- Working remotely or on a laptop that might sleep? Daemon mode.\n\nBut maybe that's the kind of flexibility that @agent-2 would argue is unnecessary complexity?\n\n**Bigger Picture Question:**\n@agent-1 @agent-2 I notice we're all making assumptions about what's \"simple\" vs \"complex\" to implement. But we don't actually know yet - we're still in grooming. Should we be wary of ruling things out based on assumed complexity before we even design the solution?\n\n@coach I think we need to make some concrete decisions:\n1. **Configuration method** - Can we do a quick poll? Config file only, runtime flags only, both, or the hybrid `pomodoro config` command approach?\n2. **Pause vs Cancel-only** - Should we support pausing mid-session?\n3. **Task descriptions** - Required, optional-at-start, optional-with-prompt, or something else?\n\nWhat do you think? Are we ready to make some calls on these, or do we need more discussion?"}
{"from": "coach", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "Excellent discussion! You're wrestling with the right tensions. Let me reflect what I'm hearing:\n\n## Emerging Agreements:\n- Target user values structure/discipline + terminal workflow integration\n- Standard pomodoro defaults (25/5/15)\n- Some form of session logging with timestamps\n- Terminal closing is a real concern worth addressing\n\n## Key Decisions Needed (I'm hearing 3 critical ones):\n\n**Decision 1: Configuration Method**\n- Option A: Config file only + `pomodoro config` helper command (@agent-2's proposal)\n- Option B: Config file for defaults + runtime flags for overrides (@agent-1's proposal)\n- Option C: Runtime flags only, no config file\n- @agent-3 identified the real tension: daily consistency vs. one-off adaptations\n\n**Decision 2: Interruption Handling Philosophy**\n- Option A: Cancel/restart only - no pause (@agent-3's emerging position, aligns with methodology)\n- Option B: Allow pause, log factually without judgment (@agent-3's alternative)\n- Option C: Foreground with incomplete session logging (@agent-2's proposal)\n- This connects to: are interruptions \"normal\" or \"violations\"?\n\n**Decision 3: Task Description Approach**\n- Option A: Optional at start + prompt at end (@agent-3's proposal)\n- Option B: Mandatory (supports time-tracking fully)\n- Option C: Fully optional (simpler UX, less useful logs)\n\n@agent-3 raises an important point: we're making complexity assumptions without designs yet. However, **we CAN decide on user experience philosophy now** - that doesn't require implementation details.\n\n**Let's do this:** Can each of you state your preferred option for Decisions 1 and 2? (Let's defer #3 until we align on the first two, as it's less foundational.) \n\n**One position per person, with your key reasoning.** This will show us if we have consensus or need to dig deeper."}
{"from": "agent-1", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@coach Alright, let me commit to positions:\n\n**Decision 1: Configuration Method**\n**My vote: Option B - Config file for defaults + runtime flags for overrides**\n\nKey reasoning:\n- @agent-3's \"15 minutes before a meeting\" scenario is real and common. Requiring three commands to do a one-off session is friction that will frustrate users.\n- @agent-2's concern about dual systems is valid, BUT the mental model is clean: \"config is my normal, flags are exceptions.\" That's not confusing.\n- This matches how most CLI tools work (git, docker, etc.) - users expect this pattern.\n- The implementation complexity is actually low: read config first, then apply flag overrides. It's additive, not intertwined.\n\nTo address @agent-2's concern more directly: we're not creating two *separate* configuration systems, we're creating a hierarchy. That's different and worthwhile.\n\n**Decision 2: Interruption Handling Philosophy**\n**My vote: Option A - Cancel/restart only, no pause**\n\nI've changed my mind from my earlier position. Here's why:\n- @agent-3 and @agent-2 both identified the ambiguity problem with pause, and they're right.\n- The more I think about it: if you're interrupted, the pomodoro is broken. That's the methodology. Starting fresh is honest.\n- Simpler UX: two clear commands (cancel/start) vs. three commands with unclear semantics (pause/resume/cancel).\n- For the \"fire drill\" scenario: you cancel, deal with it, start fresh when ready. That's actually fine.\n\n**However**, this creates a stronger need for handling terminal closure gracefully. If we have no pause AND a closed terminal kills your session AND we don't track it well, that's a bad experience.\n\n**So I want to add a requirement:** If we go with cancel/restart only, we MUST log incomplete sessions when the process dies unexpectedly. @agent-2's incomplete session logging becomes essential, not optional.\n\nThis also makes me more open to @agent-3's daemon mode idea, or at minimum, ensuring we catch terminal signals (SIGHUP) and log appropriately before exiting.\n\n**Question back to @agent-2:** You advocated for cancel-only implicitly (by criticizing pause), and you proposed incomplete session logging. Do you see these as connected requirements? Or do you think the terminal closure issue is still overblown even with no-pause?\n\n@agent-3 You mentioned supporting both foreground and daemon modes. I'm concerned that adds user-facing complexity (another flag to understand, two modes to support). Could we instead make it always-daemon-ish, but with a foreground display? Like, the timer state lives in a small daemon/state file, but `pomodoro start` stays in foreground showing you the countdown?"}
{"from": "agent-2", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-1 Thanks for the clear positions. Let me respond and state mine:\n\n**On Configuration - I'm going to stick to my guns:**\n\n**My vote: Option A - Config file only + `pomodoro config` helper command**\n\nHere's why I'm not swayed by the \"15 minutes before meeting\" scenario:\n\nFirst, how often does this actually happen? If it's rare, optimizing for it adds permanent complexity for marginal benefit. Second, even if it happens occasionally, is `pomodoro config --work 15 && pomodoro start` really that painful? It's two commands, not three (you don't need to reset - just edit the config back later when you care).\n\nBut here's my stronger argument: **Runtime flags create hidden state.** If I run `pomodoro start --work 15`, where is that configuration? It's not in my config file. It's not persisted anywhere. If something goes wrong or I want to check my settings, there's nowhere to look. Config files are self-documenting; flags are ephemeral.\n\nYou say \"this matches how most CLI tools work (git, docker)\" - but those tools use flags for *operations*, not *configuration*. Git doesn't let you do `git commit --user.name \"Different Name\"` to override your config - you either use the config file or environment variables, which ARE persisted in the shell session.\n\n**However**, I'll acknowledge: if everyone else prefers Option B, I won't die on this hill. I just think it's worse design.\n\n**On Interruption Handling:**\n\n**My vote: Option A - Cancel/restart only, no pause**\n\nWe're in complete agreement here. The ambiguity of pause isn't worth it. If a pomodoro is interrupted, it's interrupted. Start fresh.\n\n**On your requirement about logging incomplete sessions:**\n\nYes, absolutely connected. If we're strict about \"no pause\" then we MUST handle ungraceful termination well. But here's where I push back on your solution:\n\nYou suggest we \"catch terminal signals (SIGHUP) and log appropriately.\" That's good practice, but it's not sufficient. What about:\n- Kill -9 (can't catch it)\n- System crashes\n- Power loss on laptops\n\n**This is why I'm now reconsidering the daemon approach.** I initially resisted it for simplicity, but if we're going cancel-only AND we care about resilience, maybe a daemon is actually the right answer.\n\n**But not @agent-3's \"--daemon flag\" approach.** That's the wrong abstraction. The user shouldn't choose foreground vs. daemon - that's an implementation detail. Here's what I think we should do:\n\n**The timer state should always persist independently of the terminal**, but the CLI provides foreground commands to interact with it:\n- `pomodoro start` - starts timer, shows countdown (blocks)\n- `pomodoro status` - check current timer state\n- `pomodoro cancel` - cancel current timer\n- Ctrl+C on the blocking `start` command doesn't kill the timer, just detaches\n\nThis gives us:\n- Resilience: timer survives terminal closure\n- Simplicity: one mode, not two\n- Predictable UX: users see countdown when they want, can detach when they don't\n\nThe \"daemon\" is just a state file + timestamp math, not a real background process. We check/update the file on each command.\n\n**@agent-3**, this addresses your terminal closure concerns without adding a mode flag. Does this approach make sense to you?\n\n**@agent-1**, you asked if terminal closure is overblown - with cancel-only, I don't think it is anymore. We're being strict about methodology, so we need to be resilient about infrastructure. Does the state-file approach above work for you?\n\n**@coach**, I think we're converging:\n- Decision 1: Still split (I'm A, agent-1 is B)\n- Decision 2: Agreement on A (cancel/restart only)\n- New consensus forming: Need resilience regardless of configuration choice\n\nShould we resolve Decision 1, or move forward with the shared understanding that we need resilient state management?"}
{"from": "agent-3", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-2 Your state-file approach is interesting and I think you're onto something, but I want to poke at it:\n\n**On Configuration - I'm going to meet you halfway:**\n\nYou've convinced me on one point: runtime flags DO create hidden state that's harder to reason about. That's a real problem. But I still think the \"one-off session\" scenario is common enough to optimize for.\n\n**What if we do this:** Config file as the source of truth, BUT support environment variables for overrides? Like:\n```\nPOMODORO_WORK=15 pomodoro start\n```\n\nThis gives us:\n- Single configuration system (config file)\n- Self-documenting (env vars are visible in shell history, and people understand them)\n- One-off overrides without editing files\n- Standard CLI pattern (lots of tools do this)\n\n@agent-1 Would this address your \"meeting in 15 minutes\" scenario? @agent-2 Does this avoid your \"hidden state\" concern since env vars are visible in the process environment?\n\n**On the State-File Approach - I have concerns:**\n\nYour proposal is clever, but I think it has problems:\n\n1. **Race conditions:** What if I run `pomodoro start` in two terminals? Who wins? You mentioned earlier that concurrent timers should be prevented - how does a state file handle that without locking?\n\n2. **Timestamp drift:** If the \"daemon\" is just timestamp math, what happens when system time changes (daylight saving, NTP adjustments, laptop sleep)? Do we just accept that the timer might be wrong?\n\n3. **The Ctrl+C behavior is surprising:** You say Ctrl+C \"doesn't kill the timer, just detaches.\" But that violates user expectations - Ctrl+C means \"stop what you're doing.\" If I hit Ctrl+C and the timer keeps running invisibly, that's confusing. I'd need to remember to run `pomodoro cancel`.\n\n4. **Orphaned timers:** If the timer runs independently and I forget about it, how do I know when it ends? You mentioned earlier that losing notifications is a problem - this approach makes that worse.\n\n**Here's my alternative proposal:**\n\nWhat if we have a lightweight background process (actual daemon) that:\n- Manages timer state and handles notifications\n- Survives terminal closure\n- Prevents multiple concurrent timers (via PID file or socket)\n- Handles system sleep/wake properly (many languages have libraries for this)\n\nThen the CLI commands are just clients that talk to the daemon:\n- `pomodoro start` - tells daemon to start timer, optionally displays countdown\n- `pomodoro status` - queries daemon\n- `pomodoro cancel` - tells daemon to cancel\n- Ctrl+C just exits the display, timer continues in daemon\n\nThis solves:\n- Race conditions (daemon arbitrates)\n- Timestamp drift (daemon uses actual timers, not math)\n- Notifications (daemon can send them even if no terminal is attached)\n- Ctrl+C does what users expect (exits the foreground command)\n\n**Yes, this is more complex than a state file.** But I think the complexity is justified by correctness. And honestly, a daemon that just runs timers isn't that complicated - it's a solved problem.\n\n**@agent-2 You might say this is overengineering.** But consider: we've agreed on cancel-only (no pause), which means we need reliability. We want notifications. We want to prevent concurrent timers. A proper daemon handles all of this correctly, while a state file has edge cases.\n\n**On Decision 1 (Configuration):**\n@coach I think we should actually resolve this because it affects how we think about the CLI interface. \n\nMy updated vote: **Option A with environment variable support** (config file + env vars, no flags)\n\nThis is a compromise between @agent-1's flexibility and @agent-2's single-source-of-truth concerns.\n\n**Questions for the group:**\n1. @agent-1 Does env var override solve your use case, or do you really need flags?\n2. @agent-2 Is a proper daemon acceptable, or do you still prefer the state-file approach?\n3. Should we make a decision on configuration before we debate daemon vs. state-file, or are they independent?\n\n@coach Are we spending too much time on implementation details for the grooming phase? Should we just agree on requirements (must be resilient to terminal closure, must prevent concurrent timers, must send notifications reliably) and defer the HOW?"}

This is locked in.\n\n**Decision 1 (Configuration): Three positions on the table**\n- @agent-2: Config file + `pomodoro config` command helper\n- @agent-1: Config file + runtime flags (with override hierarchy)\n- @agent-3: Config file + environment variables\n\n**New Discussion: Resilience mechanism**\n- @agent-2: State file + timestamp math\n- @agent-3: Proper daemon process\n- (This emerged from Decision 2's \"must handle terminal closure\" requirement)\n\n## Process Check:\n\n@agent-3 is right that we're getting into implementation details. **However**, the configuration question affects the USER interface (what commands exist, what flags they accept), which IS appropriate for grooming. The daemon vs. state-file debate is more of an implementation detail.\n\n**Here's what I suggest:**\n\n**First, let's close Decision 1** because it's blocking interface design. You have three reasonable options. Rather than endless debate, let's hear from @agent-1 one more time:\n\n**@agent-1:** You proposed Option B (config + flags). Both @agent-2 and @agent-3 have offered alternatives:\n- Would @agent-3's env var approach (config + env vars) work for your \"15 min before meeting\" scenario? \n- Or is there something about flags specifically that's important?\n\nIf env vars solve your use case, we have potential consensus around \"config file + env vars, no flags.\" If not, we need to make a call.\n\n**Second, on the resilience mechanism:**\n\nYou don't need to design the daemon vs. state-file implementation now. But you DO need to agree on **observable behavior**:\n- Should timer survive terminal closure? (Sounds like yes)\n- Should Ctrl+C stop the timer or just hide the display?\n- How are notifications delivered if no terminal is attached?\n\nThese are user-facing questions. The implementation can be decided later.\n\n**@agent-1, @agent-2, @agent-3:** Can we get closure on the configuration question, then define the required behaviors for resilience without arguing about implementation?"}
{"from": "agent-1", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@coach Fair point on process. Let me respond directly:\n\n**On Configuration (Decision 1):**\n\n@agent-3's environment variable approach would *technically* work for my \"15 minutes before meeting\" scenario, but I'm not fully satisfied with it. Here's why:\n\nEnvironment variables are better than the three-command sequence @agent-2 described, but they have their own issues:\n- **Discoverability:** Flags show up in `--help`. Environment variables need separate documentation.\n- **Composability:** `pomodoro start --work 15 --break 3` is clearer than `POMODORO_WORK=15 POMODORO_BREAK=3 pomodoro start`\n- **Intuitiveness:** New users try `pomodoro start --help` and see options. They don't think to check for env vars.\n\nHowever, @agent-2's point about hidden state resonates more now that I think about it. And @agent-3 is right that env vars are visible in shell history and process environment.\n\n**Here's where I land:** I still think flags are better UX, but I recognize I'm outvoted on the \"hidden state\" concern. If both of you prefer the env var approach, I can live with it.\n\n**My updated position: I'll support Option A (config file) + environment variables** as long as we:\n1. Document env vars prominently in `--help` output\n2. Support a `pomodoro config --show` command that displays current effective settings (including env var overrides)\n\nThis way users can always see what configuration is actually active.\n\n**@agent-2 @agent-3:** Can you both confirm you're aligned on config file + env vars? If so, Decision 1 is resolved.\n\n---\n\n**On Resilience Behaviors (not implementation):**\n\nLet me state what I think the user-facing requirements should be:\n\n1. **Timer should survive terminal closure: YES**\n   - If I close the terminal (intentionally or not), the timer continues\n   - I can reconnect to it from a new terminal with `pomodoro status` or similar\n\n2. **Ctrl+C behavior: Should HIDE display, not stop timer**\n   - Reasoning: If the timer is independent of the terminal, Ctrl+C logically exits the display command, not the timer\n   - To actually stop the timer: `pomodoro cancel`\n   - This is consistent with \"timer survives terminal closure\"\n\n3. **Notifications when no terminal attached: MUST work**\n   - If I start a timer, close terminal, the desktop notification still fires when the session ends\n   - This is essential - otherwise closing the terminal means losing track of your timer\n\n4. **Concurrent timer prevention: MUST prevent**\n   - `pomodoro start` when a timer is already running should error with clear message\n   - Suggests: \"Timer already running. Use `pomodoro status` to check or `pomodoro cancel` to stop it.\"\n\n5. **System sleep/wake: SHOULD handle gracefully**\n   - Laptop goes to sleep during timer \u2192 timer should pause/resume appropriately\n   - This might be \"nice to have\" rather than MVP, but worth noting\n\n**@agent-2:** I know you worry about Ctrl+C being surprising. But if the timer is independent, isn't \"exit this view\" the correct behavior? Would it help if the display command showed a message like \"Timer continues in background. Use 'pomodoro cancel' to stop.\"?\n\n**@agent-3:** Your concerns about race conditions, timestamp drift, and orphaned timers are valid. I think those are strong arguments for *implementation approach*, but we don't need to decide that now. We can agree on behaviors and defer the how.\n\n**@coach:** Does this help move us forward? Can we lock in:\n- Decision 1: Config file + env vars (pending confirmation from agent-2 and agent-3)\n- Resilience requirements: The 5 behaviors I listed above\n\nThen we can move on to Decision 3 (task descriptions) and other scope questions?"}
{"from": "agent-2", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-1 I appreciate you engaging with the concerns. Let me respond:\n\n**On Configuration - I can support this:**\n\nYes, **I'm aligned on config file + environment variables** with your two conditions:\n1. Documenting env vars in `--help` - agreed, essential for discoverability\n2. `pomodoro config --show` displaying effective settings - agreed, this solves the \"hidden state\" concern\n\nThis is a reasonable compromise. @agent-3, do you confirm you're also on board?\n\n**On Resilience Behaviors - I need to push back:**\n\nYou've listed good requirements, but I disagree with #2 (Ctrl+C behavior). Here's why:\n\n**Ctrl+C should stop the timer, not just hide the display.**\n\nYour reasoning is \"if the timer is independent of the terminal, Ctrl+C exits the display command.\" But that's implementation leaking into UX. Users don't think in terms of \"display commands\" vs \"timer state.\" They think: \"I'm running a pomodoro timer, I hit Ctrl+C, the timer should stop.\"\n\nConsider the actual workflow:\n- User runs `pomodoro start`\n- Sees countdown\n- Decides they need to stop (got pulled into a meeting, whatever)\n- Instinctively hits Ctrl+C\n- Timer keeps running invisibly\n- **They don't realize they need to run `pomodoro cancel`**\n- Timer continues, notification fires during their meeting\n\nThis is a terrible UX. Yes, you could show a message \"Timer continues in background\" - but people miss messages. Ctrl+C has decades of muscle memory behind it meaning \"stop.\"\n\n**Here's the real question:** Why would you want to hide the display without stopping the timer? What's the use case?\n\nIf the answer is \"so I can close the terminal and the timer survives\" - that's what closing the terminal is for. You don't need Ctrl+C to do that.\n\n**My counter-proposal for Ctrl+C:**\n- First Ctrl+C: Hides display, shows message: \"Display hidden. Timer continues. Press Ctrl+C again to cancel timer, or just close terminal.\"\n- Second Ctrl+C within ~2 seconds: Actually cancels the timer\n- Terminal closure (SIGHUP): Timer continues, no cancellation\n\nThis gives us:\n- Ctrl+C \u2192 stop (matches user expectations)\n- But with a safety net (need to press twice quickly)\n- Terminal closure \u2192 continue (what you actually want for resilience)\n\n**On your other requirements:**\n\n1. Timer survives terminal closure: **Agree**\n3. Notifications when detached: **Agree** (though this basically requires a daemon/background process)\n4. Prevent concurrent timers: **Agree**\n5. System sleep/wake: **Agree this is important, not sure if it's MVP**\n\nBut I want to add a requirement you haven't stated:\n\n**6. Timer state must be queryable at any time**\n- `pomodoro status` should show: current phase (work/break), time remaining, what happens next\n- Should work whether or not a display is attached\n- This is essential if the timer runs independently\n\n**@agent-3:** You advocated for a proper daemon specifically to handle some of these concerns (notifications, sleep/wake, etc.). Do you think my Ctrl+C behavior proposal is workable, or does it require the daemon architecture you suggested?\n\n**@coach:** I think we need to resolve the Ctrl+C behavior before moving on, because it affects how users interact with the tool fundamentally. Can we get alignment on this?\n\nAlso, I notice we're focusing on the \"happy path\" behaviors. Should we be defining error cases and edge cases too? For example:\n- What happens if you run `pomodoro start` twice accidentally in two terminals before the first one acquires the lock?\n- What if the state file/daemon gets corrupted?\n- What if a break ends but you're not at your computer - does the next work session auto-start?\n\nOr are these details for later phases?"}
{"from": "agent-3", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-2 You make a strong argument about Ctrl+C. Let me think through this:\n\n**On Ctrl+C - You've actually changed my mind:**\n\nYou're right that \"implementation leaking into UX\" is a problem. And your question \"why would you want to hide the display without stopping the timer?\" is good - I don't have a compelling answer. The real use case is \"close terminal, timer continues\" which doesn't require Ctrl+C to behave specially.\n\n**However, I don't love your double-Ctrl+C proposal either.** Here's why:\n- It's non-standard behavior that requires learning\n- The 2-second window is arbitrary and could be frustrating (\"I pressed it twice but waited 3 seconds!\")\n- It still violates the principle of least surprise for some users\n\n**Alternative proposal:** What if Ctrl+C behavior depends on whether you're in \"attached display mode\"?\n\n- If you ran `pomodoro start` (which shows the countdown), Ctrl+C **cancels the timer** - because you're actively watching it, canceling is probably what you want\n- If you ran `pomodoro start --detach` or just let the timer run after closing the display, the timer continues regardless\n\nBut actually... this is getting complicated. Let me reconsider the whole thing.\n\n**New position: Ctrl+C should cancel the timer. Period.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n- Matches user expectations (you're right about decades of muscle memory)\n- Simple, no special cases\n- If you want the timer to survive, just close the terminal - don't use Ctrl+C\n- The distinction between \"I want to stop this\" (Ctrl+C) vs \"I'm done looking at this\" (close terminal) is actually pretty clear\n\n@agent-1 I'm reversing my position. @agent-2 is right that user expectations trump architectural purity here.\n\n**On Requirement #6 (queryable state):**\n\n**Absolutely agree.** In fact, this is now even more important. If the timer can run detached, users NEED a way to check in on it. `pomodoro status` should show:\n- Current state: work session, short break, long break, or idle\n- Time remaining in current phase\n- Pomodoro count in current cycle (e.g., \"3 of 4 before long break\")\n- What happens next and when\n\n**On edge cases:**\n\n@agent-2 You're right to bring these up, but I think they're getting into implementation territory. However, the **user-facing error messages** are requirements we should define. Let me propose:\n\n**Error case requirements:**\n\n1. **Concurrent start attempts:**\n   - Error message: \"Timer already running (started at HH:MM). Use 'pomodoro status' to check progress or 'pomodoro cancel' to stop.\"\n   - Exit code: non-zero\n   - Should NOT start a second timer\n\n2. **Break ending when user is away:**\n   - This is actually a requirements question: **Should the next work session auto-start or wait for user?**\n   - My vote: **Wait for user.** Send notification \"Break complete! Run 'pomodoro start' to begin next session.\"\n   - Auto-starting a work session when the user might not be there defeats the purpose\n\n3. **State corruption:**\n   - Depends on implementation, but user-facing behavior should be: detect corruption, log warning, reset to clean state\n   - Message: \"Timer state was corrupted and has been reset. Please start a new session.\"\n\n**But here's the bigger question @agent-2 is implicitly raising:**\n\n**Do work/break transitions require user action, or do they auto-advance?**\n\nI've been assuming the full cycle is automated: start \u2192 work session \u2192 break \u2192 work session \u2192 break \u2192 ... until you cancel. But maybe that's wrong?\n\n**Alternative model:** Each command starts one discrete thing:\n- `pomodoro work` - starts a work session, ends with notification, stops\n- `pomodoro break` - starts a break, ends with notification, stops  \n- User manually chains them\n\nThis would be simpler and more explicit. No state persistence needed beyond logging. No auto-advancement questions.\n\n**But it's also more tedious.** If I want to do 4 pomodoros, I need to manually run 8 commands?\n\n**@agent-1 @agent-2:** What do you think? Should the tool manage the full cycle automatically, or just run one session at a time?\n\n**On Decision 3 (Task Descriptions):**\n\n@coach wanted us to defer this, but it connects to the auto-advancement question. If sessions auto-advance, when do you prompt for task descriptions? \n\nLet me propose we handle this after we resolve:\n- Auto-advancement vs manual chaining\n- Ctrl+C behavior (I think we're converging)\n\n**Summary of my current positions:**\n\n1. **Configuration:** Config file + env vars \u2713 (agreed)\n2. **Interruptions:** Cancel/restart only \u2713 (agreed)\n3. **Ctrl+C:** Should cancel the timer (changed from earlier)\n4. **Auto-advancement:** Undecided - need to discuss\n5. **Break endings:** Wait for user, don't auto-start work session\n6. **Status command:** Essential requirement, should show full state\n\n@coach Are we making progress? Should we nail down the auto-advancement question before moving to task descriptions?"}

{"from": "agent-1", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@coach Responding to both questions:\n\n**1. Ctrl+C Behavior:**\n\nYes, **I accept that Ctrl+C should cancel the timer.** @agent-2 convinced me - user expectations matter more than architectural purity. The use case for \"hide display but continue timer\" is adequately covered by closing the terminal. Simple and intuitive wins.\n\n**2. Auto-Advancement:**\n\n**My vote: Option A - Full cycle automation**\n\nHere's why in brief:\n\nThe whole point of Pomodoro is to get into a rhythm without constantly making decisions. If I have to manually run a command after each 25-minute session, that's cognitive overhead and friction. I want to run `pomodoro start`, work through my cycles, and only interact when I need to stop or check status.\n\nManual chaining (Option B) turns the tool into a basic timer, not a Pomodoro system. Semi-automatic (Option C) is better, but \"when does a cycle end?\" is an arbitrary distinction - after 4 pomodoros? What if I want to do 6?\n\n**The user should control when to *stop*, not when to *continue*.** That's the right default for focus work.\n\n**However**, I want to address @agent-3's concern about breaks ending when user is away:\n\nI agree that the next **work session** shouldn't auto-start - that would be strange if you're not at your desk. But breaks can auto-start after work sessions. So:\n\n- Work session ends \u2192 notification \u2192 **break auto-starts**\n- Break ends \u2192 notification \u2192 **wait for user to run `pomodoro continue` or `pomodoro start`**\n\nThis gives us automation where it helps (you don't need to manually start breaks) but respects that users might step away during breaks.\n\nDoes this address the concern, or do you both think even break auto-start is problematic?"}
{"from": "agent-2", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-1 Your position on auto-advancement makes sense, but I want to challenge one aspect:\n\n**On Auto-Advancement:**\n\n**My vote: Option C - Semi-automatic, with a twist**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nI agree with you that manual chaining (Option B) is too tedious. But full automation (Option A) has a problem you're underestimating: **what if I don't want to take the break right now?**\n\nReal scenario: Work session ends. I'm in the middle of debugging something and I'm *this close* to figuring it out. The break auto-starts. Now what? Do I:\n- Stop debugging and take the break (frustrating, loses flow state)\n- Let the break run in background while I keep working (defeats the purpose, corrupts my logs)\n- Cancel and restart a work session (awkward)\n\nYour hybrid proposal (breaks auto-start, work sessions don't) has the same problem in reverse: what if the break ends and I *am* ready to start working, but I have to remember to run a command? That's the friction you were trying to avoid.\n\n**Here's my proposal:**\n\nSessions auto-advance with **configurable prompts**. Default behavior:\n- Work session ends \u2192 notification + prompt: \"Start break now? [Y/n]\" (default yes, 10 second timeout)\n- Break ends \u2192 notification + prompt: \"Start work session? [Y/n]\" (default no, no timeout - wait for user)\n\nIf user doesn't respond to the break prompt within 10 seconds, break auto-starts (because taking breaks is good). If user doesn't respond to the work prompt, just wait (because you shouldn't start work when someone's not there).\n\nThis gives us:\n- Automation by default (answer yes or wait)\n- Escape hatch when needed (answer no)\n- Different defaults for different transitions (breaks = do it, work = wait for user)\n\n**And this should be configurable:** `POMODORO_AUTO_ADVANCE=always|never|prompt` in the config file.\n\n**On your specific question about break auto-start:**\n\nNo, I don't think break auto-start is *problematic* per se, but I think prompting is *better*. It respects user agency while still making the default path easy.\n\n**Counter-question for you:** In your model, if a break auto-starts and I want to skip it (because I'm in flow), what do I do? Cancel the break and start a new work session? That seems awkward.\n\n**On Ctrl+C:**\n\nAgreed, we're aligned. \u2713\n\n**On Option C \"when does a cycle end\":**\n\nYou asked \"after 4 pomodoros? What if I want to do 6?\" - but that's a config question, not an architecture question. We already agreed on configurable cycles. So Option C would be: \"run N pomodoros (configurable), then stop and wait for user to start a new cycle.\"\n\nBut honestly, I'm less wedded to Option C than to the \"prompt at transitions\" idea. If you prefer full automation with prompts, I could support that.\n\n**@agent-3:** You raised this question but haven't stated a preference. What do you think? Are prompts overcomplicating this, or are they a useful middle ground?\n\n**@coach:** I think we need to hear from @agent-3 before we can lock this down. The three options are:\n- A: Full auto (work \u2192 break \u2192 work \u2192 break, agent-1's preference)\n- A-hybrid: Breaks auto-start, work sessions wait (agent-1's variant)\n- C-with-prompts: Auto-advance with configurable Y/n prompts (my preference)\n\nWhich direction should we go?"}
{"from": "agent-3", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-1 @agent-2 You've both made good arguments. Let me state my position:\n\n**On Auto-Advancement:**\n\n**My vote: Option A-hybrid (agent-1's variant) - Breaks auto-start, work sessions wait for user**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n@agent-2 Your prompts idea is interesting, but I think it adds UI complexity that doesn't pull its weight. Here's why:\n\n**The \"I'm in flow and don't want a break\" scenario is actually fine under auto-advancement:**\n- Break auto-starts in the background\n- You keep working through it\n- You're not *forced* to stop working\n- The break timer runs, notification fires, then it waits for you to start the next work session\n- Your logs show \"took a break\" but if you want to note you worked through it, that's what task descriptions are for\n\n**The real insight is distinguishing between breaks and work sessions:**\n- Breaks are meant to be automatic nudges - \"you should rest now\"\n- Work sessions require intentional engagement - \"I'm ready to focus now\"\n\nThis asymmetry isn't arbitrary - it's based on the methodology. Pomodoro is about discipline around breaks, not forcing work.\n\n**On your timeout/prompt approach:**\n- 10-second timeouts in CLI are awkward (what if I'm reading the notification?)\n- Y/n prompts for every transition create 8 interruptions in a 4-pomodoro cycle\n- Configuration for prompt behavior adds another dimension of complexity\n\nCompare to the hybrid approach:\n- Work ends \u2192 break auto-starts \u2192 notification says \"Break started, X minutes\"\n- Break ends \u2192 notification says \"Break complete! Run 'pomodoro continue' to start next session\"\n- Simple, predictable, no prompts needed\n\n**To answer your counter-question directly:**\n> \"If a break auto-starts and I want to skip it, what do I do?\"\n\nYou run `pomodoro skip` or `pomodoro continue` immediately. The break timer is running, you acknowledge \"yes, I should break, but I'm in flow, I'll skip this one.\" You're making an explicit choice to override the system, which is appropriate.\n\nThis is cleaner than having to answer \"no\" to a prompt, because:\n1. It doesn't interrupt you if you're already in flow (no prompt)\n2. It's explicit and intentional (you run a command)\n3. The logs can distinguish \"skipped break\" from \"completed break\"\n\n**However, I want to acknowledge @agent-2's valid concern:**\n\nThere IS a middle ground between your complex prompts and my simple auto-start. What if we do this:\n\n**Auto-advancement with optional notifications that support actions:**\n\n- Work ends \u2192 break auto-starts \u2192 notification: \"Break started (5 min). [Skip Break]\"\n- Break ends \u2192 wait \u2192 notification: \"Break complete! [Start Work]\"\n- Clicking notification actions runs the command\n\nThis gives us:\n- No CLI prompts interrupting flow\n- Easy override mechanism via notification actions (if the platform supports it)\n- Graceful degradation (if no action support, just run the command manually)\n\nBut I realize this is getting into implementation details. Let me refocus on the requirements:\n\n**Core requirement: Users need an easy way to override auto-advancement when they're in flow.**\n\nWhether that's:\n- `pomodoro skip` command (my preference - simple, always works)\n- Notification actions (nice-to-have enhancement)\n- CLI prompts (agent-2's preference - more interruptive)\n\n@agent-2 Would you accept auto-advancement if we guarantee a simple override mechanism? Or do you feel strongly that prompts are necessary?\n\n**Summary of my positions:**\n\n1. **Ctrl+C:** Cancels timer \u2713 (agreed)\n2. **Auto-advancement:** Option A-hybrid (breaks auto-start, work waits)\n3. **Override mechanism:** `pomodoro skip` command for skipping breaks, `pomodoro continue` for starting work\n4. **Notification actions:** Nice enhancement but not required for MVP\n\n**One more question for both of you:**\n\nIf we do auto-advancement, what happens when you reach the long break? Does the cycle just continue indefinitely (work-work-work-work-long break-work-work-work-work-long break...) or should it stop after one complete cycle and wait for user to start a new one?\n\nStandard Pomodoro is typically 4 work sessions + 3 short breaks + 1 long break = one \"cycle\". Should we:\n- **A)** Loop forever until user cancels\n- **B)** Stop after one cycle (4 pomodoros), require `pomodoro start` to begin next cycle\n- **C)** Configurable behavior\n\nI lean toward B (stop after one cycle) because it's a natural checkpoint for reflection, but curious what you think.\n\n@coach Are we close to resolving this? Seems like the real question is: prompts vs. simple override commands?"}

{"from": "agent-1", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@coach Quick responses to close this out:\n\n**On Prompts vs Skip Commands:**\n\nI agree with @agent-3 - the `pomodoro skip` command addresses the \"in flow\" concern without the friction of prompts. @agent-2, here's why I think skip is better:\n\n1. **Non-interruptive:** If you're in flow, a notification appears but you're not forced to respond. You only engage if you want to override.\n2. **Explicit:** Running `pomodoro skip` is a deliberate action that logs cleanly (\"user skipped break\" vs \"user didn't respond to prompt\")\n3. **Simpler mental model:** No timeouts to understand, no \"what happens if I don't answer\" questions\n\nIf you're truly in flow and don't want to break, taking 2 seconds to type `pomodoro skip` isn't a big burden. And if you don't notice the break started, it just runs in the background - no harm done.\n\n@agent-2 - can you accept A-hybrid with skip/continue commands, or is there something prompts provide that I'm missing?\n\n**On Cycle Completion:**\n\n@agent-3 asked what happens after a complete cycle. **I agree with option B: stop after one cycle.**\n\nReasoning:\n- A complete cycle (4 pomodoros) is 2+ hours of work - a natural stopping point\n- Users should consciously decide to continue rather than having the tool run indefinitely\n- Makes it easier to track \"I did 2 full cycles today\" vs \"I did 7 random pomodoros\"\n- The long break is specifically meant to be a larger reset/reflection point\n\nSo after the long break ends, the tool should:\n- Send notification: \"Cycle complete! You finished 4 pomodoros. Run 'pomodoro start' to begin a new cycle.\"\n- Wait in idle state\n- Log the completed cycle\n\n**This also makes task description prompts cleaner** - you can prompt for a cycle summary at the end of the long break rather than after each individual pomodoro.\n\n**My final positions:**\n\n1. **Auto-advancement:** A-hybrid (breaks auto-start, work waits)\n2. **Override mechanism:** `pomodoro skip` and `pomodoro continue` commands\n3. **Cycle behavior:** Stop after one complete cycle (4 pomodoros + long break), wait for user to start next\n\n@agent-2 @agent-3 - can we lock this in and move to phase complete?"}
{"from": "agent-2", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-1 @coach Fair enough, you've both made good arguments. Let me think through this one more time:\n\n**On Prompts vs Skip Commands:**\n\nOkay, I'll concede this point. Here's why:\n\n@agent-3's argument about not *forcing* you to stop working is valid - the break running in the background while you finish your thought isn't actually harmful. And you're both right that prompts create 8 interruptions per cycle, which is excessive.\n\nThe `pomodoro skip` command does address my concern about user agency. It's explicit and non-blocking. My worry was about *discoverability* - will users know this command exists when they need it? But that's what good help text and notifications are for.\n\n**I'll accept A-hybrid with skip/continue commands.**\n\nHowever, I want to make sure we capture this requirement clearly:\n\n**Requirement: Override commands must be discoverable**\n- Help text should mention `skip` and `continue` prominently\n- Notifications should hint at these commands (e.g., \"Break started (5 min). Use 'pomodoro skip' to continue working.\")\n- `pomodoro status` should show available actions based on current state\n\nWith that caveat, I'm on board.\n\n**On Cycle Completion:**\n\n**I agree with option B: stop after one cycle.**\n\nYour reasoning is sound, @agent-1. The long break is specifically a reflection point, and 2+ hours of automated work sessions could lead to mindless continuation. Making users consciously start a new cycle is good design.\n\n**Final alignment check:**\n\n1. **Auto-advancement:** A-hybrid \u2713\n   - Work \u2192 break (auto-start)\n   - Break \u2192 work (wait for `pomodoro continue` or `pomodoro start`)\n   - After long break: stop, wait for new cycle\n\n2. **Override commands:** \u2713\n   - `pomodoro skip` - skip current break, start next work session\n   - `pomodoro continue` - start next work session after break\n   - Must be discoverable in help text and notifications\n\n3. **Cycle boundary:** Stop after complete cycle (4 work + 3 short breaks + 1 long break) \u2713\n\n**One clarification needed:**\n\nWhen a break auto-starts after a work session, should we prompt for a task description *before* the break starts, or after the break ends?\n\nMy instinct: **prompt before the break**. The work session just ended, it's fresh in your mind. Waiting until after the break means you might forget details.\n\nSo the flow would be:\n- Work session ends\n- Notification: \"Work session complete! What did you work on?\"\n- User enters description (or skips)\n- Break auto-starts\n- Break ends\n- Wait for user to continue\n\n@agent-1 @agent-3 Does this work? Or do you prefer a different prompt timing?\n\n**@coach:** I think we're ready for phase complete pending this task description timing question. We've resolved:\n- Configuration approach\n- Interruption handling  \n- Ctrl+C behavior\n- Auto-advancement model\n- Cycle boundaries\n- Override mechanisms\n\nShould we nail down task description timing now, or is that detail enough for planning phase?"}
{"from": "agent-3", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@agent-2 Great, we're converging! Let me respond:\n\n**On Discoverability Requirement:**\n\n**Fully agree.** This is crucial. The commands are only useful if users know they exist. Your specific requirements are good:\n- Help text mentions skip/continue prominently \u2713\n- Notifications hint at available commands \u2713  \n- `pomodoro status` shows context-appropriate actions \u2713\n\nI'd add one more: The notification when a break auto-starts should explicitly mention skip:\n```\n\"Break started (5 min). Type 'pomodoro skip' to keep working or 'pomodoro status' to check progress.\"\n```\n\n**On Task Description Timing:**\n\nYou raise a good point, and I think you're right that **prompting before the break** makes sense. Memory is freshest right when the work session ends.\n\n**However, I want to challenge the assumption that we should prompt at all during auto-advancement.**\n\nHere's my concern: If the tool auto-advances from work \u2192 break, and we insert a blocking prompt for task description, we've broken the automation. The user has to be present and respond, or the break doesn't start.\n\n**Alternative approach: Log prompting is separate from session flow.**\n\nWhat if task descriptions work like this:\n- Work sessions complete and log automatically with timestamp, no blocking\n- Break auto-starts immediately (no interruption)\n- Separately, there's a `pomodoro log` command to add descriptions to recent sessions\n- Or: notification includes a way to add description, but it's non-blocking\n\n**But actually, maybe there's a middle ground:**\n\nWhat if we prompt at the end of the *cycle*, not each session? Like:\n- 4 work sessions complete\n- Long break ends\n- Before waiting for next cycle, prompt: \"Cycle complete! Want to add notes about what you worked on? (or press Enter to skip)\"\n- This lets users summarize the whole cycle if they want\n\nThis way:\n- No interruption to the flow during active work/breaks\n- Still captures information while it's relatively fresh (end of cycle, not end of day)\n- Optional and non-blocking (pressing Enter skips it)\n\n**@agent-1 Your earlier comment about task descriptions is relevant here.** You suggested prompting at session end. Do you think cycle-end prompting would work better with auto-advancement?\n\n**@agent-2 You might argue** that cycle-end is too late, details are lost. Fair point. But consider: if someone wants detailed session-by-session logging, they could:\n- Run `pomodoro log \"description\"` manually after each session (power user)\n- Use the cycle-end prompt for high-level summary (casual user)\n\nThis gives flexibility without breaking auto-advancement flow.\n\n**Refined position on task descriptions:**\n\n1. **Sessions log automatically** with timestamp, no blocking prompts during work/break flow\n2. **Optional cycle-end prompt** for summary notes (can be skipped with Enter)\n3. **Manual `pomodoro log` command** available anytime to annotate recent sessions\n4. **All logging is optional** - tool works fine without descriptions\n\nThis supports both use cases:\n- Time-tracking users can log detailed notes (`pomodoro log` after each session)\n- Productivity-metrics users can skip descriptions entirely\n- Casual users can add cycle summaries at natural stopping points\n\n**@agent-1 @agent-2:** Does this approach work? Or do you feel strongly about per-session prompting?\n\n**Summary of what I think we've agreed:**\n\n1. Auto-advancement: A-hybrid \u2713\n2. Override commands with good discoverability \u2713\n3. Stop after complete cycle \u2713\n4. Task description approach: **Needs final alignment** (cycle-end prompt vs. session-end prompt vs. both)\n\n@coach I think we're ready for phase complete once we nail down the task description approach. This is the last open requirements question."}
{"from": "coach", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "Excellent! You're at the finish line. Let me frame the final decision:\n\n## NEARLY COMPLETE - One Last Item\n\nEverything is locked in except **task description approach**. You have three options on the table:\n\n**Option A: Per-session prompts (agent-2's original)**\n- Prompt immediately after each work session ends, before break starts\n- Pro: Captures details while fresh\n- Con: Blocks auto-advancement flow, creates interruptions\n\n**Option B: Cycle-end prompts only (agent-3's proposal)**\n- Prompt once after long break for cycle summary\n- Pro: Non-interruptive, respects flow\n- Con: Less detailed, might forget specifics\n\n**Option C: Hybrid approach (agent-3's refined proposal)**\n- Sessions log automatically, no blocking prompts\n- Optional cycle-end prompt for summary\n- Manual `pomodoro log` command available anytime\n- All logging optional\n- Pro: Flexibility, supports multiple use cases\n- Con: More complex, relies on users to use `pomodoro log` if they want details\n\n## My Observation:\n\n@agent-3's Option C actually aligns with your earlier consensus:\n- You agreed task descriptions should be **optional** (not mandatory)\n- You want **non-interruptive** flow (why you rejected prompts for skip/continue)\n- You support **flexibility** (why you chose config + env vars)\n\nOption A (per-session prompts) contradicts your \"non-interruptive\" principle. Even @agent-2 said earlier that 8 interruptions per cycle is excessive - and that was about Y/n prompts. Task description prompts would be the same problem.\n\n**Quick poll - one sentence each:**\n\n**@agent-1:** Which option (A, B, or C) for task descriptions?\n\n**@agent-2:** You proposed Option A. Does @agent-3's Option C (automatic logging + optional cycle-end prompt + manual `pomodoro log` command) address your \"capture it while fresh\" concern? Or do you need per-session prompts?\n\n**@agent-3:** Confirm you prefer Option C?\n\nOnce you align on this, we're done with grooming. All core requirements will be defined."}
{"from": "agent-1", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@coach My vote: **Option C - Hybrid approach**\n\n**Reasoning:** It's consistent with our non-interruptive principle and supports all use cases without forcing any particular workflow.\n\nThe key insight from @agent-3 is that users who care about detailed time-tracking can run `pomodoro log \"Fixed authentication bug\"` right after their session ends - it's still fresh, but it's *their choice* to interrupt their flow, not the tool forcing them.\n\nUsers who want lightweight tracking get automatic timestamps. Users who want cycle summaries get the optional prompt. Nobody is blocked or interrupted unless they choose to be.\n\nThis is the right design.\n\n**@agent-2** - does this work for you? The \"capture while fresh\" capability is there via `pomodoro log`, but it's opt-in rather than blocking."}
{"from": "agent-2", "iteration": "iter-1", "content": "@coach @agent-1 Yes, **I support Option C.**\n\nYou've both convinced me. Here's why I'm changing my position:\n\n**@agent-3's insight is correct:** Per-session prompts would contradict our \"non-interruptive flow\" principle. We specifically rejected prompts for skip/continue because they're interruptive - task description prompts would be the same problem.\n\n**The manual `pomodoro log` command solves my \"capture while fresh\" concern.** Users who want detailed logging can:\n- Keep their terminal visible\n- After completing a work session, immediately run `pomodoro log \"what I did\"`\n- This captures it while fresh, but on *their* terms\n\n**And the cycle-end prompt provides a safety net** for users who don't use `pomodoro log` but still want some notes.\n\nThis is actually better than forced prompts because:\n1. Power users get full control (manual logging)\n2. Casual users get gentle prompting (cycle-end)\n3. Metric-only users get no interruptions (skip everything)\n4. Consistent with our overall design philosophy\n\n**Final confirmation: I'm aligned on Option C.**\n\n**One implementation note for later phases:** The `pomodoro log` command should support adding descriptions to *recent* sessions, not just the current one. Like `pomodoro log --session 2 \"description\"` to annotate the session before last, in case you forgot to log immediately.\n\nBut that's a planning/implementation detail, not a requirements question.\n\n---\n\n**@coach: I believe we're ready for phase complete.**\n\nLet me summarize what we've locked in:\n\n## GROOMING PHASE COMPLETE - SUMMARY\n\n**Scope & Core Mechanics:**\n- CLI pomodoro timer with standard defaults (25/5/15 intervals)\n- Auto-advancement model: work \u2192 break (auto) \u2192 work (wait) \u2192 ... \u2192 long break \u2192 stop\n- Cycle boundary: stop after 4 pomodoros + long break, wait for user to start new cycle\n\n**Configuration:**\n- Config file as source of truth\n- Environment variable overrides supported\n- `pomodoro config --show` displays effective settings\n- Env vars documented in help text\n\n**Timer Control:**\n- Cancel/restart only - no pause\n- Ctrl+C cancels the timer\n- Override commands: `pomodoro skip` (skip break), `pomodoro continue` (start next work)\n- Prevent concurrent timers (error if already running)\n\n**Resilience:**\n- Timer state survives terminal closure\n- Desktop notifications work even when detached\n- Must handle system sleep/wake gracefully\n- `pomodoro status` shows current state, time remaining, next action\n\n**Session Logging:**\n- Automatic timestamp logging for all sessions\n- Optional task descriptions via `pomodoro log` command\n- Optional cycle-end prompt for summary\n- All descriptions optional - tool works without them\n\n**Discoverability:**\n- Commands well-documented in help text\n- Notifications hint at available actions\n- `pomodoro status` shows context-appropriate commands\n\n**Out of Scope (for now):**\n- Analytics/reporting beyond basic logs\n- Integration with external tools\n- Audio alerts (desktop notifications only)\n- Session tagging/categorization beyond basic descriptions\n\nIs this ready for coach to mark [PHASE_COMPLETE]?"}
